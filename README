# Digital Signal Processing test

## Getting started

*Note:* This repo was authored on M2 MacOS using Python 3.12; build tools tested there.

- The first time you use the repo, run `./init.sh` to set up a Python virtual environment and install local dependencies.
  - You can also rerun this command to update dependencies, if they change upstream.
- Every time you're going to start developing, run `source activate` to enter the virtual environment.
- Source files are stored in `/src`

## Making changes

- If you pull in extra dependencies, update deps list: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- Test, commit and push to a branch. Use pull requests.
